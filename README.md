# ship_efficiency_analysis_modeling_deployment
This model is deployment-ready, designed to predict ship fuel consumption and CO2 emissions with high accuracy (R² = 0.9937 for fuel and R² = 0.9321 for emissions). It integrates machine learning, time series analysis, enhance fuel efficiency, and reduce emissions, enabling real-time decision-making for sustainable shipping operations.
